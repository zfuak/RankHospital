thank you all for coming to my mock presentation. very happy to be embarrassed later on. 
so today I want to talk about an empirical bayes application to ranking and selection. 
given a set/collection of estimates of the innate characteristics, how do I select the top a20 percents? would it be possible to control the false discovery rate?
the data that I have is on the French Hospitals. a pretty extensive, public available dataset that is not widely exploited. output and input etc. if you are interested in the hospital/health maybe useful to take a look.

my motivation: it is of human nature to rank and select the best/worst inidividual units based on some kind of measures. e.g. for teacher, chetty et al on the ranking of teachers. however most of the time, what we have is a pretty noisy estimate of the . Prior distribution. Make use of that.
